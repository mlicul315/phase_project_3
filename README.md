## Overview 
Terry Stops permit law enforcement to detain an individual based on reasonable suspicion of a crime. In 1967-1968 the Supreme Court case, Terry v. Ohio, the court ruled that stopping an individual on suspicious behavior does not violate the ‘unreasonable search and seizure’ clause of the Fourth Amendment. Thus, Terry Stops were born. 

I analyzed Terry Stop data from the Seattle Open Data database. I looked over 50,000 cases of Terry Stops between 2015-2022 and built a prediction model to gain insight on what ploicy changes and community efforts can be made to reduce the number of arrest. 

## Buisness Case
As an independent data scientist, my goal was to analyze Terry Stops that ended in an arrest. I analyzed Terry Stop data from the Seattle Open Data database. I looked over 50,000 cases of Terry Stops between 2015-2022 and built a prediction model to gain insight on what ploicy changes and community efforts can be made to reduce the number of arrest.
